I am a platform engineer at anynines, where I work on building and designing Kubernetes control plane components for managing data services at scale. I am interested in thinking about distributed systems, Linux, and security. My drive lies in conceiving, designing, and improving systems that can make computers and organizations work better.

Outside of that, I enjoy mountain biking, running, being outdoors, and listening to audio.
